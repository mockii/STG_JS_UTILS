        stateProvider
            .state('welcome', {
                url: "/",
                templateUrl: "welcome/welcome.tpl.html",
                controller: "WelcomeController as welcomeController",
                data: {
                    pageTitle: "Welcome!"
                }
            });
    }]);</pre>
</p>

<h3>Navigation Control</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        The navigation bar is controlled in the application controller <code>client/src/app/app.js</code> and
        index.html <code>client/src/index.html</code> files.<br/>
        <pre>
appController.navItems = [
    {
        pageName: "Welcome",
        state: "/"
    }
];</pre>
        <pre>
&lt;div stg-nav-bar class="page-header" menu-items="appController.navItems"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

    This item accepts an array of objects, with <code>pageName</code> and <code>state</code> as the keys.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
    <span class="alert alert-info"><i class="icons icon-info"></i> Super-lists will be added in the future
        (multi-dimensional array objects)</span>
</div>

<h3>Building</h3>
<p>
    You'll notice that your <code>dist</code> folder will have some additional files included into it.  This is the
    result of integrating the STGWebUtils Client Libraries into the project. The package is installed via <kbd>npm
    install</kbd> which references the package in the <code>src/client/package.json</code> file.
</p>
<p>
    During install, the <code>src/client/gruntfile.js</code> will reach into the <code>src/client/node_modules</code>
    folder, retrieve the appropriate assets (js, css, images, fonts, etc), and place them into the appropriate folders
    in the <code>src/client/dist</code> folder. <br/>
    <span class="label label-danger"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-fire"></i> There are <b>NO</b> file checks
        in place to prevent overwriting an existing library asset file.</span>
</p>
